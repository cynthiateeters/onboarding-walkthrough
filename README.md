**Date:** July 22, 2025 at 9:58 AM ET

**Subject:** Simplified VS Code Onboarding with Manual Profile Management and Basic Git Setup

**Purpose:** Streamlined approach using manual profile loading and a simple Git configuration extension for reliable student onboarding

---

## Scenario Overview

This walkthrough demonstrates a **simplified, reliable approach** where students manually load a pre-configured VS Code profile and use a minimal extension focused solely on Git configuration. This approach prioritizes **consistency and reliability** over full automation.

**Student Profile:**
- **Name**: Sarah Johnson
- **Course**: Web Development I
- **Assignment**: VS Code Environment Setup and Git Configuration
- **Experience Level**: Beginner (may or may not have existing VS Code setup)

**Key Changes from v5:**
- **Manual profile loading** using VS Code's built-in profile import
- **Simple Git-only extension** for basic configuration
- **Reduced complexity** with proven, reliable methods
- **Focus on core learning objectives** without automation complications

---

## Pre-Scenario Setup (Instructor Actions)

### Step 1: Extension Development
**Instructor/Department has completed:**
- Developed **Git Configurator for Grid** - Simple extension focused only on Git setup
- Extension prompts for Git username/email and sets global configuration
- Extension creates `git-config-check.txt` verification file
- No profile management - keeps extension simple and reliable

### Step 2: Course-Specific Easy-Setup Repository
**Each course has its own easy-setup repository containing:**
```
web-dev-1-easy-setup/              # Course-specific repository
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Web Development I.code-profile  # Pre-built VS Code profile for manual import
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ git-configurator-for-grid.vsix  # Simple Git configuration extension
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                       # Step-by-step manual instructions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html                      # Course welcome page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ welcome-cats-dots.svg           # Course assets
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore                      # Git ignore rules
```

### Step 3: Profile Content
**The `.code-profile` file includes:**
- **Editor Settings**: 16px font, rulers at 80 columns, auto-save
- **Git Integration**: Auto-fetch, smart commits, merge editor
- **HTML/CSS Tools**: HTMLHint, Stylelint with student-friendly rules
- **Required Extensions**: Live Server, Path Intellisense, Color Highlight
- **Development Environment**: Optimized for course requirements
